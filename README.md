## Movie Rating Prediction

This project predicts whether a particular movie review on Rotten Tomatoes is labeled as "Rotten," "Fresh," or "Certified-Fresh."

Approach

We used a dataset from Rotten Tomatoes to predict the ratings of the movies. We approached this problem by considering both numerical and categorical features. We identified the numerical and categorical features in the dataset and visualized their distributions. We then used decision tree and random forest classifiers to train and test our models.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains movie data from Rotten Tomatoes. The data includes information such as movie ratings, runtime, and content rating.

## Requirements

This project requires the following packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

## Results

We achieved an accuracy of 99% for our random forest classifier model. The most important features for predicting the movie rating were found to be the audience count, the tomatometer rating, and the runtime.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Rotten Tomatoes for providing the dataset used in this project.
